# Settings Configuration
*Written by: Grant Nelson*

# Summary
This guide provides instructions for configuring preference settings in Blender to enhance the 3D modeling and animation workflow. Key areas covered include:

- [Preferences Menu](#accessing-preferences-menu): Working through Blender's preferences settings to start customization.
- [Configuring Peripherals](#configuring-peripherals): Tailoring display and input device settings for optimal use of Blender’s features.
- [Defaults](#defaults): Managing startup files and factory settings to maintain a consistent working environment.

By customizing these settings, users can streamline their workflow, improve project organization, and improve their personal interactions with Blender.

## Accessing Preferences Menu

To navigate to the the Preferences menu, access `Edit > Preferences' using the navigation bar at the top of the screen.

## Defaults

### Import Existing Settings
Import settings from previous Blender installations or configurations via `File > Defaults > Load Factory Settings`, then `Edit > Preferences` to fine-tune as previously described.

### Create New Defaults
Adjusted preferenses are automatically changed when saved. To customize your startup file with preferred objects, lighting, and camera setups, configure them in your current project and save via `File > Defaults > Save Startup File`.

### Loading Factory Settings
Revert to Blender’s original settings at any time by selecting `File > Defaults > Load Factory Settings`, providing a clean slate for configuration.
