# Scaling Models
<information>
Below is a standard cube in the traditional blender project layout, in order to be able to manipulate the size of th√® object it is best to move to the **Layout** Tab.
</information>

1. Selecting the object you wish to resize/move/rotate by clicking on it in the workspace, or clicking on its label in the scene layout pane. 
2. Open the **Object** pane as denoted by a "<img class="icon" src = "images\objectIcon.png">".  
3. ![Object Pane](images/objectPanedCollapsed.png) Select the **Transform** tab in the **Object** sub-menu.
   - <information>The transform menu is what enables you to precisely move, turn, and stretch an object. It is split into 3 sections *Location*, *Rotation*, and *Scale* with each of these menus split into *X*, *Y*, and *Z*. These are representative of the 3 traditional axis of a 3d plane in math. Modifying each of these options will affect the object relative to the plane. </information>
4. Scale, Rotate, and Move the Object as you see fit.
   - Move
     - <div class = "information">The Location tool operates by sliding your object in relation to there relative axis in terms of meters. To slide the object forward, to the right, or up add to the x, y, z units. To move an object backwards, to the left, or down subtract from the x, y, or z units</div>
   - Scale
     - <div class = "information">The Scale tool adjusts the size of your object along its x, y, and z axes. To enlarge the object, increase the scale values, and to shrink the object, decrease the scale values. </div>
   - Rotate
     - <div class = "information">The Rotate tool allows you to turn your object around its x, y, and z axes. Rotation is measured in standard degrees. To rotate clockwise, increase the rotation values. To rotate counterclockwise, decrease the rotation values.</div>

5. Locking Object Properties (Optional)

 If you want to ensure that the properties of an object stay the same regardless of other factors, you can lock the properties of an object by clicking on the "<img class="icon" src = "images\lockIcon.png">" icon to the side of the property. You can unlock the property at any time to continue editing by clicking on the "<img class="icon" src = "images\lockIcon.png">" icon again to unlock the property.</div>
