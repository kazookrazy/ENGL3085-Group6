# Styling

## Images
Images should break the text and fill the sides, to make them more visibly seen as a separate part of instructions. All images should also labeled to keep in line with accessibility concerns. (Note: image descriptions should not start with "Image of ..." or the like as screen readers used by the visibly impaired will already denote them as images.)
