## Images
<information>

Images should break the text and fill the sides, to make them more visibly seen as a separate part of instructions. All images should also labeled to keep in line with accessibility concerns. (Note: image descriptions should not start with "Image of ..." or the like as screen readers used by the visibly impaired will already denote them as images.)

For images that are used to highlight menus, options a red (<span style="color: #ff0000;">#ff0000</span>) box should be placed around the necessary UI. The selected UI should follow standard default UI to avoid confusion.

Example:
