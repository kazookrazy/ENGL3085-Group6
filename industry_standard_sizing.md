# Industry standard sizings

<information>
When it comes time to build out a 3d model for a part often what comes up is how do I maintain a consistent scale through out my project to maintain interoperability, so that when it comes time to assemble the parts all work together seamlessly. This is often done through the setting a common conversion through out your project. By default most industry use the 1 unit = 1 mm standard when it comes to sizing for 3d prints. However larger more industrial groups use ____. However one of  the key ways to promote interoperability is through the use of standardized connectors. These include nuts, bolts, motors, and other select parts. So in this section we will walk through how to add industry standard parts to your projects.
