# Importing an Object

<information>One of the key things to do when compositing scene is adding the objects from several people/projects into one collective scene. This is done through the use of importing an object.</information>

## Supported File Types
<information>Blender supports a variety of file formats, however due to the fact that some file formats are proprietary, and the fact that not all file formats are meant to be 3D, such as .csv files, not all file types are supported. So below is a compiled list of supported file formats.</information> 


| File Type | Extension | Information |
|----|----|------|
| Blender | .blend | 3D Object |
| FBX | .fbx | 3D Object |
| Wavefront | .obj | 3D Object |
| Collada  | .dae | 3D Object |
| Alembic | .abc | 3D Object |
| Stanford | .ply | 3D Object |
| Stl | .stl	 | 3D Object |
| glTF | .gltf | 3D Object |
| X3D Extensible | .x3d | 3D Object |
| AutoCad DXF | .dxf | 3D Object |
